# Microservices-Task

## Overview
This document provides details on testing various services after running the `docker-compose` file. These services include User, Product, Order, and Gateway Services. Each service has its own endpoints for testing purposes.

For the complete architecture, Docker, verification, API, and troubleshooting guide, see [docs/MICROSERVICES_GUIDE.md](docs/MICROSERVICES_GUIDE.md).
